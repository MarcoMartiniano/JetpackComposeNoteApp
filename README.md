## JetpackComposeNoteApp

Jetpack Compose - MVVM - ROOM

This project is a study from the video [How to Make a Clean Architecture Note App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YPXv7xKh2w)

The folder 'com.marco.jpappnote.core.presentation.components' was created for components that are used
in differents places multiply times on code, we don't need it for our project, I just left it for
study purposes.
